# Esoteric Ideation and Mass Engagement
I enjoy working at Adobe.

One of my favorite benefits at Adobe is [Garage Week](https://blog.developer.adobe.com/garage-week-how-adobe-fosters-a-culture-of-innovation-in-security-4d4f0dadcf56). It is a week where we pause normal obligations and work on whatever crazy ideas we've considered during the rest of the year. And there are few restrictions: a project can be something related to your job, or it could be something completely unrelated. (I guess I've never actually probed the outer limits of what's acceptable. Maybe next year I'll try writing a horror-romance novel just to see if it's allowed.)

My ideas tend to be pretty out there. I always go into Garage Week intending to be a team player on others' idea but I inevitably change my mind and work on my own cool ideas. And my ideas have never attracted other volunteers.

That's never bothered me. I like being the guy out in the middle of nowhere, finding cool ideas that others haven't thought of. But it does make it hard to pitch ideas to others.

## How To Present Random Ideas To Others In Interesting Ways
My most recent Garage Week project was once again a solo foray into the great unknown: I explored model checking — think [TLA+](https://learntla.com/), except that I used [Recife](https://github.com/pfeodrippe/recife).

I didn't get very far in my project because I was on-call the first half of the week and had a sick family the latter half. That was discouraging because it meant that not only did I have an esoteric project (model checking _in Clojure_), but I also didn't reach any impressive milestones to draw attention to my work.

That got me thinking about how to present esoteric ideas to a larger audience. The further away an idea is from an individual's (and therefore, a community's) knowledge, experience, or interest, the smaller the group of individuals interested in hearing about it. That conclusion seemed to doom me to forever working on my esoteric ideas in isolation, never really reaching mass interest.

But is that always true? Is it possible to make an esoteric idea interesting to the masses by reframing it in terms of things they care about? That's probably the right way to do it: reframe my esoteric project in language or connections that my intended audience cares about. Do they care about cost? Do they care about minimizing negative customer impact? Do they, like me, love esoteric ideas for their own sake?
