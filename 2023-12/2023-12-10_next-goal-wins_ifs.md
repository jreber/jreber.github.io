# "Next Goal Wins" and Internal Family Systems
## IFS
I've been listening to the audiobook of [No Bad Parts](https://ifs-institute.com/nobadparts), by Richard Schwartz. He is the creator of Internal Family Systems (IFS).

In my (very) non-expert understanding, IFS views human minds not as a single entity with hopes, dreams, desires, traumas, and disorders. Rather, IFS views each mind as a collection of parts. Parts can work well together or can work dysfunctionally together. "Dysfunctionally" can mean, for example, that some parts try to dominate, bully, pacify, or exile other parts — just like in a dysfunctional family. (Understand the source of the name now?)

A fanciful example of this is Bruce Banner in the various Marvel films. For example, in Thor: Ragnarok, he tells Thor [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSl4VJuF-Dk):

> I mean in the past, I always felt like Hulk and I each had a hand on the wheel. But this time, it's like he had the keys of the car and I was locked in the trunk.

And it goes further: _We_ can enable some of that dysfunctional behavior by allowing parts to be dominated, bullied, pacified, or exiled. And the way we treat our parts carries over into the way we treat people in the real world. Do you bully the weak, immature inner child part of your mind? Do you also react negatively, or even bully, the weak, immature child-like individuals around you?

(Again, I am not a therapist. I am not trying to give a thorough description of IFS. My sole purpose in this section is to explain my understanding of IFS and how it relates to what I saw in "Next Goal Wins.")

## "Next Goal Wins"
If you aren't familiar with the move "Next Goal Wins," go watch [the trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRH5u5lpArQ).

The main character is Thomas Rongen, a Dutch-American soccer player and coach who helped the American Samoa soccer team to _not_ lose.

I am not going to be like [Cinema Therapy](https://www.youtube.com/@CinemaTherapyShow) because Jonathan Decker is a licensed therapist and I am not. But I was struck by Thomas Rongen's inner demons and how his inner turmoil mirrored the way he treated others. The anger and epithets he threw at others mirrored the anger and epithets he seemed to throw at himself.
