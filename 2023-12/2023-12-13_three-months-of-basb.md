# Three Months Of "Building A Second Brain"
Roughly three months ago, I finished reading [Building a Second Brain](https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/book), by Tiago Forte.

I don't want to get lost in a description but it's like [Getting Things Done](https://gettingthingsdone.com/) meets [How To Read A Book](https://fs.blog/how-to-read-a-book/) meets... Evernote.

That previous paragraph was not pretentiousness; those comparisons are intentional.
- Like _Getting Things Done_, _Building a Second Brain_ (hereafter _BASB_ because that's too much repetition) is not just about how to take notes gooder; it is about how to manage your digital knowledge so that you can actually _get stuff done_ instead of getting lost in an endless sea of "to read" bookmarks, random notes on your desktop (computer or physical), and phone "to do" reminders.
- Like _How To Read A Book_. _BASB_ is about making the tools work for you as effectively and efficiently as possible. _How To Read A Book_ talks about first changing your perspective on reading, and then discusses specific approaches to get the most from your reading. _BASB_ talks about changing your perspective on what you know and how you store it, and then gives specific approaches to get the most from your knowledge and knowledge management system.
- Evernote... is a note-taking app. _BASB_ is superficially about managing your notes. Nothing deep there.

## My Experience Before _BASB_
### In The Beginning: Scraps of Paper; Piles Everywhere
Before I came across _BASB_, my knowledge was scattered _everywhere_. Ask my wife one of the defining features of my life and "piles" will probably be the the first thing she says. I wrote all my fleeting ideas on scraps of paper that happened to be nearby. I gave no thought how to organize these incomplete thoughts, so I would leave them where I happened to be standing — on my nightstand, on the kitchen table, in my pants pocket, shoved in every conceivable drawer.

But such a simple, ad hoc system only worked when life was simple. Pretty soon, I had a newborn baby and a new job at Amazon. I needed to better track my responsibilities and knowledge.

### Microsoft OneNote, Evernote
Not much to tell about the next phase: I tried using OneNote, and then Evernote. I ended up abandoning both because they forced me to record my thoughts in _their_ format. There were some cool features but these tools forced me to record my "round peg" thoughts in the "square peg" hole. The aggravation drove me to abandon both tools.

Why did that aggravate me so much? I am a software developer and I strongly think that the language one uses shapes one's thoughts. Conversely, one's thoughts can only be expressed in an appropriately expressive language. So the impedance mismatch between my thoughts and the tools OneNote and Evernote offered me meant that I couldn't effectively represent my ideas in those tools — not without extra, creativity-killing labor to massage my ideas into their tools.

### Obsidian, Pre-_BASB_
I found the personal blog of a former coworker. He used [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for his notes and publishing. I have learned a lot from him over the years, so I was curious about Obsidian. I was intrigued by its use of Markdown and plain directories; such a pairing could allow endless flexibility in how I structure my notes. Perhaps this could be the solution to my OneNote/Evernote frustrations!

Obsidian definitely helped: I took lots of notes (particularly for work) in Obsidian.

I still, however, had a frustration about my notes: They were write-only notes. I never reviewed them or learned from them. And while I told myself to go back and review them to turn them into something more useful, I never did and never would.

### Obsidian + _BASB_
_Building a Second Brain_ changed that for me in a few major ways:
- Changing my perspective on the purpose of a knowledge management system
- Suggesting a structure to my notes, so that they don't become digital "piles" any more (PARA)
- Suggesting techniques for revisiting notes, so they are no longer "write only" (intermediate packets, project reviews)
- Intelligent highlighting ("progressive summarization"), because I never knew how to highlight effectively

## Three Months of _BASB_
How have things changed for me in the past three months?

First, I want to brag about some basic stats:
- My personal "second brain" has 131k words, or ~400 "essay" pages of text
- My work "second brain" has 174k words, or ~500 "essay" pages of text

Those numbers don't mean anything in isolation, so don't worry about topping my "score." Those numbers amaze me because as I said before, I used to not take notes. I hated journaling. I learned whatever could stay in my brain, and that wasn't much. Learning new things felt like a sieve: new information had a depressing short half-life before it just fell out.

There have also been several impactful follow-on consequences. I had lousy self-awareness. I had lousy time management. I was constantly relearning things rather than moving my career, my personal goals, and my friends and family forward. It sucked. But the ideas of _BASB_ have helped me to incrementally improve my self-awareness (by recording my thoughts and feelings in real time), my time management (by recording my to-dos, all their necessary context, my priorities, etc., in a unified system that I actually look at), and my ability to learn and progress (by identifying and reusing intermediate packets, by actually finishing projects I start).

So did _BASB_ basically change my whole life? Ehh... kinda. _BASB_ brought me new ideas and perspectives; but I incorporated them into my life and changed as a result of what I learned from _BASB_. _That_ partnership is what changed the trajectory of my life.

For three months, anyways.
