# Defining The Value Of Life Through Absense
I have long struggled to recognize the value of my own life. Not in a suicidal way, mind you. But I've never known why people would want to visit with me, to be friends with me, to _choose_ to spend time with me. I've always been something of a social chameleon — becoming who I needed to be in a given situation. Authenticity is not something I've understood. And so I've come to ascribe others' willingness to spend time with me to the quality of the mask I wear around them.

An idea came to me that I'd come across a few years ago, and it has given me the first glimpse of how to understand how to value my life.

## "Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance"
"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance" is a philosophical book disguised as a fictional autobiography (and barely fictional at that, I think). Much of its idea were too dense for me, but I really related to it talking about the difficulties of fatherhood.

That, however, is not the idea that returned to me a few days ago. The book's narrator describes his alterego's struggle to define "quality" beyond an "I know it when I see it" vagueness. He felt he had to give or proper Platonic definition of the concept's attributes — clearly demarcate what is and is not "quality" — before he could claim that it was a real, objective thing. If he failed to do that, then any argument he made about "quality" would be easily dismissed as purely subjective and contextual.

And then the narrator remembered that a concept could also be defined by its _absence_. So "quality" could be defined — and its _objective_ existence established — by showing that if this as-yet-undefined thing were removed from existence, the world would necessarily change in a drastic way.

_That_ is the idea that returned to me a few days ago.

## What Would The World Be Like Without Me?
I started to consider the perspective of my family, friends, and coworkers. What would life be like for them if I stopped existing today? (Again, this isn't a suicidal thought; it's a thought experiment to change my perspective.)

As much as I like to think I'm a solid software developer, I think I'm rather fungible. My team would be back to full capacity maybe six months after my "disappearance."

What about my wife and kids? I am not going to get personal in a public blog, but I think there are parts of me they'd miss.

What about my friends? Are my relationships purely transactional? I hope not; if they are, then my friends probably won't miss me borrowing tools and pantry staples from them. But if there is more in the relationship — Do they seem to unburden around me? Do I help them laugh? Am I there for them when they struggle or need help? — then there would be a hole left in there lives by my disappearance.

And that hole, that void left behind by my hypothetical absence tells me that I really do contribute something to those around me. That tells me that I really do share something
