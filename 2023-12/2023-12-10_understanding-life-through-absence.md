# Defining The Value Of Life Through Absense
I have long struggled to understand why people would want to visit with me, to be friends with me, to _choose_ to spend time with me. I've always been something of a social chameleon — becoming who I needed to be in a given situation. Authenticity is not something I've understood. And so I've come to ascribe others' willingness to spend time with me to the quality of the mask I wear around them.

An idea came to me that I'd come across a few years ago, and it has given me a new perspective to consider why others might sincerely value a relationship with me.

## "Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance"
"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance" is a philosophical book disguised as a fictional autobiography (and barely fictional at that, I think).

In one section, the book's narrator describes his alter ego's struggle to define "quality" beyond an "I know it when I see it" vagueness. He felt he had to give a proper Platonic definition of the concept's attributes — clearly demarcate what is and is not "quality" — before he could claim that it was a real, objective thing. If he failed to do that, then any argument he made about "quality" would be easily dismissed as purely subjective and contextual.

And then the narrator remembered that a concept could also be defined by its _absence_. So "quality" could be defined — and its _objective_ existence established — by showing that if this as-yet-undefined thing were removed from existence, the world would necessarily change in a drastic way.

_That_ is the idea that returned to me a few days ago.

## What Would The World Be Like Without Me?
I started to consider the perspective of my family, friends, and coworkers. What would life be like for them if I were abducted by aliens today?

As much as I like to think I'm a solid software developer, I am probably pretty fungible. My team would be back to full capacity maybe six months after my "departure."

What about my wife and kids? I am not going to get personal in a public blog, but I think there are parts of me they'd miss. (Sadly, my homemade compost bin would probably be neglected.)

What about my friends? Are my relationships purely transactional? I hope not; if they are, then my friends probably won't miss me borrowing tools and pantry staples from them. But if there is more in the relationship — Do they seem to unburden around me? Do I help them laugh? Am I naturally there for them when they struggle or need help? — then my departure would leave a hold in their lives.

And that hole, that void left behind by my hypothetical abduction tells me that I really do contribute something to the lives of those around me. And that something — that slight improvement to their lives and happiness — is probably the piece of _me_ that they value in their lives. That is the part of me that leads them to value having a friendship with me.
