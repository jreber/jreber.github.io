# Negative Counterfactuals In Other Areas
I previously talked about [using negative counterfactual to recognize the role one plays in others' lives](2023-12-10_understanding-life-through-absence). By _negative counterfactual_, I mean imagining a fact _not_ being true.

I've noticed a few other domains using this same technique.
- [_No Bad Parts_](https://ifs-institute.com/nobadparts), which describes the Internal Family Systems (IFS) therapy approach, frequently brings up the idea of asking our parts, "What do you think would happen if you didn't play the rolw you currently play?" (I previously brought up IFS in ["Next Goal Wins" and Internal Family Systems](2023-12-10_next-goal-wins_ifs.md).)
- [_The Book of Beautiful Questions_](https://amorebeautifulquestion.com/the-book-of-beautiful-questions/), which is a book about the art of asking more and better questions, frequently suggests negative counterfactuals like, "What will happen if I don't take this proposed action?" and "What would I do if I knew I couldn't fail?"

I find this interesting. Perhaps _Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance_ brought up an underappreciated technique.
