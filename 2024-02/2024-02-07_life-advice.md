# Life Advice
If I had to give a piece of advice to my kids right know, and suggest tools to help them, it would be this: Life is confusing. All the old guardrails that told you how to be, how to act, and what sort of life or career to lead are ending. Everyone will try to tell you what to think, what to believe, and how to behave.

Most of the time, such advice will be well-intentioned bullshit. Please learn to think critically, learn to recognize and value what _you_ already know and believe, and always be learning and updating what you know and believe.

That's the advice; what tools would I suggest to help them live this advice?
- _Learn to think critically:_ There are many great resources out there; I'll start with _[The Book of Beautiful Questions](https://amorebeautifulquestion.com/the-book-of-beautiful-questions/)_.
- _Learn to recognize and value what you know:_ _[Building a Second Brain](https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/book)_, and if others criticize where you stand, remember [Rudyard Kipling](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/46473/if---): "... If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you // But make allowance for their doubting too;"
- _Always be learning and updating what you already know and believe:_ Paul Graham's essay [_Keep Your Identity Small_](https://paulgraham.com/identity.html) is a great start, as is Col. John Boyd's essay [_Destruction and Creation_](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/58a3add7e3df28d9fbff4501/t/58a4a32ce4fcb5d8f00b7243/1487184684871/Destruction+and+Creation_3+Sep+1976.pdf)
