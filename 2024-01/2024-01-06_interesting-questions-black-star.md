# Interesting Questions: Can A Black Star Exist?
I am not a physicist but I guess the answer is no: stars are hot, hot things emit light, "black" is the absence of light, and so a "black star" (characterized by no light) must be completely cold.

But the question gets interesting if you pick it apart. What is a star? Are all stars hot? Is it possible to have a cold or even solid star?

The answer to all those questions is probably no. According to [Encyclopedia Brittanica](https://www.britannica.com/science/star-astronomy), a star must be luminous on its own; I suspect that definition is representative of what astrophysicists would say. _Black body radiation_ is the concept that everything has energy and things with energy radiate that energy away as electromagnetic radiation; hotter things emit higher-frequency radiation, which I think is why the hottest stars are blue.

But what happens as an object gets hotter? Does it only emit higher-frequency radiation, or does it emit _more_ radiation? Higher-frequency electromagnetic radiation carries more energy, so it seems plausible that a hotter black body could emit the same rate of photons but the photons are higher-energy, higher-frequency photons. Or maybe a hotter body emits both more photons _and_ higher-frequency photons.

And must stars be "_balls of gas burning_ billions of miles away," as Pumba in _The Lion King_ says? Probably, if you want to see it in the night sky. I don't know the math but the [Wikipedia article on black-body radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-body_radiation_) says that a room-temperature object emits in the infrared range. Create a Sun-sized ball of room-temperature rock and it will probably squish itself into much hotter magma. (New question: Where did that extra heat energy come from?) Eventually, though, I think that magma would cool back into a slightly smaller, infrared-emitting ball of rock. Without fusion to keep it hot, it won't be luminous very long and so would not be considered a star.

Are there any other ways one might construct a black star?
