# Contradictions Are Subjective
I [previously](./2024-01-15_contradictions) said that Jayne Cobb from _Firefly_ was a contradiction.

In the episode _Jaynestown_, Jayne — a character who values muscle and firepower more than charm intellect or morality — is claimed to be the hero of Jaynestown because he'd previously showered cash on the impoverished, oppressed village. Turns out — spoilers! — that Jayne accidentally dumped the money when his ship was damaged; he also dumped is partner in attempt to cut weight.

Jayne had no illusions that he was a hero, and he hated that the townspeople lionized him. Jayne was no contradiction to himself but he hated the contradiction that was forced on him — the contradictory image of him the townspeople held in their minds.

What other subjective contradictions can exist?

## Las Vegas
I was born outside Las Vegas and I still have ties to the area.

But that Las Vegas is different than the Las Vegas most of the world interacts with. _That_ Las Vegas includes a [mini version of New York City](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&sca_esv=fa2eff043ab95eb5&sxsrf=ACQVn09JkOUqzhl_AD8xmuAyEN8O72Dfig:1706498843863&q=new+york+new+york+las+vegas&tbm=isch&source=lnms&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjOoJfL04GEAxUWH0QIHclOAbEQ0pQJegQIDhAB&biw=1037&bih=545&dpr=3.33), a [fake Egypt](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&sca_esv=fa2eff043ab95eb5&sxsrf=ACQVn09JkOUqzhl_AD8xmuAyEN8O72Dfig:1706498843863&q=new+york+new+york+las+vegas&tbm=isch&source=lnms&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjOoJfL04GEAxUWH0QIHclOAbEQ0pQJegQIDhAB&biw=1037&bih=545&dpr=3.33), [Caesars Palace](https://www.google.com/search?q=caesars+palace+las+vegas&tbm=isch&ved=2ahUKEwjdiYTr04GEAxVHMEQIHfKqB08Q2-cCegQIABAA&oq=caesar&gs_lcp=CgNpbWcQARgAMg0IABCABBCKBRBDELEDMgoIABCABBCKBRBDMgoIABCABBCKBRBDMg0IABCABBCKBRBDELEDMgoIABCABBCKBRBDMggIABCABBCxAzIKCAAQgAQQigUQQzIICAAQgAQQsQMyCAgAEIAEELEDMgoIABCABBCKBRBDOgUIABCABDoGCAAQCBAeOg4IABCABBCKBRCxAxCDAVDhZ1i-cmDRemgBcAB4AIABdYgBpAWSAQM0LjOYAQCgAQGqAQtnd3Mtd2l6LWltZ8ABAQ&sclient=img&ei=Xhu3Zd3iJ8fgkPIP8tWe-AQ&bih=545&biw=1037&client=firefox-b-1-d) two thousand years too late, and (until recently) [dolphins](https://www.8newsnow.com/news/local-news/mirages-secret-garden-and-dolphin-habitat-to-permanently-close-after-more-than-30-years-on-las-vegas-strip/). It's not only anachronistic, it is also _[anatopistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatopism)_ — I had to look that word up. Basically, the most visible parts of Las Vegas are from a completely different time and place than the hot, dry Mojave desert.

Therein is the contradiction: The whole entertainment industry in Las Vegas is built as a sustained fantasy. The twinkling lights of Vegas would be very different if it were built of low adobe building and sagebrush.

But others do not see any contradiction at all. Perhaps my "contradiction" is what draws people to Vegas. Nobody goes to Vegas to see desert; they go to be entertained. It's not that they want the contradiction, but rather that the contradiction is invisible beneath what the human imagination conjures.

## Gay Soccer Hooligan
I read an article over a decade ago about a British football hooligan who was also gay; I sadly cannot find the article now.

That combination of attributes contradicted my stereotype of what gay men were like. The gay men I'd known up to that point were not violent, and they acted in ways I regarded as traditionally feminine, such as knitting scarves in class and [speaking with an effeminate lilt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay_male_speech).

This article was the first time I encountered the idea that gay men are not all the same. Some, like this football hooligan, were violent thugs at home among other violent thugs.

I don't think any of these gay men — the gay men I knew personally as well as this decades-ago hooligan — would view themselves as contradictions. I think the contradiction was in my head: these men didn't conform to the way I thought they were.
