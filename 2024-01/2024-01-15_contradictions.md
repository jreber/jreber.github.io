# Contradictions
Contradictions are fascinating

They can be funny. Consider a crowd experiencing the torment of crucifixion [singing about looking on the bright side of life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJUhlRoBL8M&pp=ygUmYWx3YXlzIGxvb2sgb24gdGhlIGJyaWdodCBzaWRlIG9mIGxpZmU%3D). Or an [anti-Roman Jewish zealot being given a British-style Latin grammar lesson under threat of castration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIAdHEwiAy8). Or a group of anti-Roman zealots protesting that [the Romans never did anything for them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qc7HmhrgTuQ). Or an [argument clinic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLlv_aZjHXc&pp=ygUPYXJndW1lbnQgY2xpbmlj). Or Gabriel Iglesias getting stopped and [responding to border agents that he has more Mexicans on his bus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAHOmmkA6xc).

The list could go on. They are involve contradictions between the words, behaviors, setting, and cultural norms involved.

But the concept of contradiction is much larger than that. Contradictions can be devastating — say, when the leader of your church is busted for embezzlement or adultery. Or when an activist or politician whose work you greatly admire turns out to be a pig of a human. A fictional example is Jayne, the [Hero of Cantaon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pI-fiGUjAPY) in _Firefly_.

> It's my estimation that every man ever got a statue made of him was one kind of sumbitch or another. — Malcolm Reynolds, _Firefly_

A real example is Charles Dickens leaving his wife for an eighteen-year old actress.

> Seldom is Charles Dickens permitted to be a real man with very real flaws. Instead he is written about as either a demon or a demigod, depending on the writer’s allegiance. — [The Forgotten Wife of Charles Dickets](https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20160519-the-forgotten-wife-of-charles-dickens), BBC, 2016-05-19

What do you do with contradictions? When is a contradiction funny and when is it heartbreaking? When do we have a hearty laugh and move on and when should we set boundaries with the personified contradiction? What kind of personified contradiction are you?
